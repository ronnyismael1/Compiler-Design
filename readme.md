# ScangrLexer Project

## Overview
This project is a lexical analyzer built using ANTLR (Another Tool for Language Recognition). The primary purpose of this project is to read an input file, tokenize its contents using a lexer generated by ANTLR, and then output the tokens to a specified output file.

## Project Structure
- **generate/**: Contains the ANTLR-generated lexer code.
- **src/**: Contains the ANTLR runtime library.
- **test-in.txt**: Example input file for testing the lexer.
- **Makefile**: Build script for compiling the project.
- **scangr.g4**: Grammar file for ANTLR to generate the lexer.
- **scangrMain.cpp**: Main program that uses the lexer to tokenize input files.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Tools Used
- **ANTLR**: Used to generate the lexer from the grammar file (`scangr.g4`).
- **g++**: GNU Compiler Collection, used for compiling the C++ code.
- **C++**: The programming language used for implementing the main program and integrating with the ANTLR-generated lexer.

## What I Learned
- **ANTLR for C++**: Gained experience in using ANTLR to generate lexers and parsers from grammar definitions and integrating them with C++ code.
- **Lexical Analysis**: Learned how lexical analyzers work and how to implement one using a tool like ANTLR.
- **File I/O in C++**: Practiced reading from and writing to files in C++.
- **C++ Project Structure**: Organized a C++ project with generated code, source files, and build scripts.

## Usage
To run the project, compile the code using the provided Makefile and execute the program with an input file and an output file as arguments.

```sh
# Build the project
make
